sentry-jira
===========

A flexible extension for Sentry which allows you to create issues in JIRA based on sentry events.
It is capable of rendering and saving many custom fields, and will display the proper fields depending on 
which issue type you are trying to create.

Attention
---------

I am developing this plugin against 2 different configurations of JIRA:

- stock JIRA in development mode
- live instance that has many specialized configurations / required custom fields

Since JIRA is so configurable, I'm looking for lots of feedback of the different ways that this breaks
with specialized configurations. Provide your feedback here: https://github.com/thurloat/sentry-jira/issues
 
Visual Walkthrough
------------------

Per-Project configurations

When viewing a Sentry event, the Actions dropdown now contains a "Create JIRA Issue" button.

The Create JIRA Issue form is fully customized based on your JIRA Configuration and loads different
fields depending on which issue type you choose.

You can now [0.5] use an auto-complete field to pull users from JIRA for any
user field.

Once the Issue has been linked through JIRA there's a link that you can follow from Sentry to
go directly to the issue on your configurated JIRA instance.

Installation
------------

Install the package via ``pip``:

::

    pip install sentry-jira


Configuration
-------------

Go to your project's configuration page (Projects -> [Project]) and select the
JIRA tab. Enter the JIRA credentials and Project configuration and save changes.
Filling out the form is a two step process (one to fill in data, one to select
project).
